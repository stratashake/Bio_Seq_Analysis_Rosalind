# Biological Sequence Analysis with Rosalind.info problems

## Description: 
This project involves solving problems from [Rosalind.info](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/). 
The scripts are organized as follows: 'Rosalind_1_25.py' covers problems 1-25, 'Rosalind_26_50.py' covers the next 25 problems, and so on.

## Motivation: 
The purpose of this project is to enhance my Python skills and stay current with bioinformatics algorithms, 
as well as BioPython and Python libraries.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository: 'git clone https://github.com/stratashake/Bio_Seq_Analysis_Rosalind'
2. Navigate to the repository: 'cd Bio_Seq_Analysis_Rosalind'

## Usage
To run a specific problem script:
1. Open the script file.
2. Uncomment the section corresponding to the desired problem.
3. (Optional) Re-comment the section before moving on to the next problem for clarity.

## Features
- Comprehensive coverage of problems from Rosalind.info, aiming to solve all problems (work in progress).

## Limitations and Learning:
While I have endeavored to solve these problems independently, seeking minimal external assistance, some were beyond my 
initial skill level. In these cases, I sought out solutions that could aid my understanding and progression. Coming from a
non-CS background, I am committed to continually enhancing my computer science knowledge.

Key learnings include:
1. Recognizing when it is wise to take breaks from coding problems or issues.
2. Perseverance and resilience in problem-solving.
3. Knowing when and how to seek help.
4. Effective utilization of resources like Stack Overflow and documentation.
