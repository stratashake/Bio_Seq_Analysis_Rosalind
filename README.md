# Biological Sequence Analysis with Rosalind.info problems

## Description: 
If you navigate to: https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ you will 
see the order in which I have solved these problems. Rosalind_1_25.py is the first
script that covers problems 1 - 25. Rosalind_26_50 covers the next 25 problems.
And so on and so forth.

## Motivation: 
The goal of this code is to hone my Python skills and stay updated with
bioinformatics algorithms and BioPython/Python libraries.

## Installation and Setup: 
1. Clone the repository: 'git clone https://github.com/stratashake/Bio_Seq_Analysis_Rosalind'
2. Navigate to the repository: 'cd .\Bio_Seq_Analysis_Rosalind'

## Usage: 
To run a specific problem script:
1. Navigate to the script file
2. Uncomment the desired problem section
3. Re-comment, if desired, before moving on to next problem

## Features: 
-Coverage of all Rosalind.info problems (or approaching all problems if 
not currently finished)

## Limitations and Learning:
I have tried my best to solve all of these problems with minimal outside help
besides general advice on sites such as stackoverflow. Not all of these problems
are within my coding abilities/understanding (these are commented on as such), but 
I was able to find and edit answers that I thought were satisfactory and able 
to help me move on to the next problem. I do not come from a CS background, 
but I'm trying to improve my CS understanding as much as I can every week. 

Solving these problems has taught me:
1. When to take a break
2. When to not give up
3. When to ask for help
4. How to find help
5. How to read documentation
